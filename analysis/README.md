# LPC Analysis & Synthesis Tools

This directory contains the scripts and tools (for modern PCs) used to perform the offline analysis and synthesis of voice packs.

The goal is to document the process of:
1. Analyzing a human voice recording to extract its LPC "vocal DNA".
2. Using this model to synthesize the phoneme banks for a target language.

This ensures the project is fully open and allows others to create new voices for moth-R.
